# Mindful Menu App 

## Introduction

Hello! Hi! I am Anja, and this is my portfolio project - progressive web application called 'Mindful Menu App'. Please notice, this is MVP, not a final version. I'm already working on other cool features I want to implement to this app! Stay tuned! :wink:

## About the app

Mindfull Menu App is dedicated to those people who want to eat healthy, but don't want to spend a lot of time cooking. The app contains simple, tasty and easy-to-make recipes for every day and any skill level. As a user of Mindful Menu App, you can create your own menu and not to be struggling every day with a question "what shall I eat today?".

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## <a name="Goals"></a> Goals

My main goal for this project was to build a full-stack app using the technologies learned in the Codaisseur bootcamp. I also wanted implement a few new skills, like building a progressive web app with React.

Also my goals were:

* Showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories;
* Practice disciplined git usage like proper commits & branching.

**Front End:

* Node.js
* React
* Redux
* Axios
* Bootstrap
* Sass
* Framer Motion

**Back End:

## <a name="Story"></a> User stories, Wireframe amd Datamodel

The [wireframe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.mockflow.com/app/wireframepro/fileexport/Export_Db790fc09326e584845c3111cf065040d.pdf) and [datamodel](https://app.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/67d6ec63-a882-4ed9-8451-e9b538320e08) I used for my project.

User stories and my plans for an app extention can be found [HERE](https://github.com/AnjaHrydziushka/Mindful-Menu-App-client/projects/1).

## <a name="Git"></a> Git Workflow

In this project I tried to use:

* Clear commit messages
* Separate branches for each new feature
* Pull requests with short descriptions

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
