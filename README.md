## Introduction

Hello! I am Anja, and this is my portfolio project - React progressive web application called 'Mindful Menu App'. Please notice, this is MVP, not a final version. I'm already working on other cool features I want to implement to this app. Stay tuned! :wink:

## About the app

Mindfull Menu App is dedicated to those people who want to eat healthy, but don't want to spend a lot of time cooking. The app contains simple, tasty and easy-to-make recipes for every day and any skill level. As a user of Mindful Menu App, you can create your own menu and not to be struggling every day with a question "what shall I eat today?".

**Progressive web app**

Mindfull Menu App is a React progressive web app. What does it mean? This is an app built from the web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but with a feel and functionality that rivals an actual native app. That means once you get the URL of this app, you can save it to your computer or smartphone and use it right from the desktop/home screen! Pretty cool, isn't it? :dancer:
